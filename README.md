# Real-Time Thread Programming Libraries

Real-time thread programming can be implemented using the following **Interface Manager libraries**.  
Each library is designed to handle a specific type of system resource or communication interface,  
enabling modular, efficient, and real-time multi-threaded software development.

## ðŸ“š Included Libraries

### 1. **Database Manager Library**
Handles real-time interactions with databases, providing a thread-safe interface for queries and transactions.

### 2. **File Manager Library**
Manages file I/O operations in a concurrent environment with built-in synchronization mechanisms.

### 3. **MQTT Manager Library**
Supports real-time message publishing and subscribing using the MQTT protocol.

### 4. **Message Queue Manager Library**
Implements a lightweight, thread-safe message queuing using ring-buffer for inter-thread communication.

### 5. **Pipe Manager Library**
Facilitates communication between processes or threads using named or unnamed pipes.

### 6. **Serial Manager Library**
Manages serial communication interfaces with support for real-time data handling.

### 7. **Table Manager Library**
Provides dynamic in-memory data table operations with support for indexing and searching.

### 8. **TCP Client Manager Library**
Handles outgoing TCP connections and client-side data exchange with multi-threading support.

### 9. **TCP Server Manager Library**
Supports incoming TCP connections with multithreaded session management and message handling.

### 10. **TeleCom Manager Library (Multicast Loopback)**
Implements tele-communication using multicast loopback.

### 11. **Time Manager Library**
Offers real-time timer and scheduling functions, suitable for periodic or delayed task execution.

### 12. **UDP Manager Library**
Enables high-speed, connectionless communication via UDP sockets.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

Download the entire code as a ZIP file and try running it in Visual Studio.  
You can include any combination of these libraries in your project depending on your communication and resource management needs.  
Each module is independently usable and thread-safe by design.
